This is a small app for therapy/counselling patients write down their daily thoughts for their therapist(s)/counsellor(s). The idea came about when I was going through counselling with the NHS and they asked me to write down my mood, note the time, and a few paragraphs of what was happening each day, all on a tiny grid where there wasn't enough room for a mouse to write it's initials.

#### Useage
##### Client

The client will log in and then be greeted with general mental health info. On the left, they'd see a menu to view a list of their currently registered therapists/counsellors (private or NHS), an option to see their previous entries, and an option to write an new entry.

The write and entry option takes the client to a page with a Word style editor, a generic choice of moods to choose from, the option to backdate/backtime their entry, and finally a list of their therapists/counsellors to chose to send the entry to.

##### Therapist/Counsellor

The therapist/counsellor will log in to see an area with notifications of which client has sent them entries for them to read. They can then proceed to read the entries and flag them for later reference if nescessary.
